 Objective:
The goal of this initial version of the project is to create a simple graphical screen using Pygame and allow a block (representing the snake) to move in response to keyboard input. This is a starter framework for building a full snake game.

📦 Project Components:
Pygame Library:

Used to handle graphics, input events (like key presses), and game loops.

Game Window:

Size: 500x500 pixels.

Background Color: Olive green (RGB: (110, 110, 5)).

Block Image:

The snake or moving element is a block image loaded from resources/block.jpg.

Initial Position:

The block starts at coordinates (100, 100).

🎮 Game Mechanics:
The main game loop listens for events like key presses or window close actions.

Arrow keys (←, →, ↑, ↓) are used to move the block by 10 pixels in the respective direction.

ESC key allows the user to exit the game.

The block's movement updates the display after each move using the draw_block() function.

🧠 Logic Flow:
Initialize Pygame and set up the window.

Load the block image and draw it on the screen.

Enter the main loop:

Check for key presses and adjust the block's position.

Redraw the block at the new location.

Quit the game on ESC or window close.

🛠️ Suggestions for Improvement:
To move from this starter to a full snake game, consider implementing:

Snake body growth when it "eats" food.

Collision detection (walls, self).

A scoring system.

A game-over screen and restart option.

Frame-based movement instead of keypress-only.
